# CPP-Design-Patterns
Reusable C++ components implementing common design patterns for easy integration into various projects.


## Overview
This repository contains generic C++ components that implement various design patterns. These components are designed to be easily integrated into new or existing projects, providing robust solutions for common software design problems.

## Components
### Singleton
A thread-safe implementation of the Singleton pattern.

### Factory
A generic factory class for creating objects based on a key and a functions provided by the user.

### ThreadPool
The ThreadPool component provides a flexible thread pool implementation for executing tasks concurrently. It allows you to efficiently manage multiple tasks across a fixed number of threads, improving performance in multithreaded environments.

## Reactor Component
The Reactor component facilitates efficient event handling, allowing callbacks for file descriptors and operations like socket I/O. Its asynchronous event-driven model is well-suited for high-performance networking and server applications.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Operating System - Linux
