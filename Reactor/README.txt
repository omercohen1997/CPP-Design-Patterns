## Overview
The Reactor design pattern allows handling of multiple simultaneous input/output (I/O) events.
The `Reactor` class in this project is designed to listen for file descriptor events using a flexible interface called `FDListener`. 
This interface can be used to listen for events with various mechanisms such as `select` or `epoll`.

## Reactor Component

#### Features
- Modular Design: The `Reactor` class uses an `FDListener` interface, allowing for easy substitution of different I/O multiplexing strategies.
- The `FDListener` interface needs to be implemented for specific event listening mechanisms (e.g., `select`, `epoll`).

### API:
- `Run()`: Starts the reactor loop (blocking call).
- `Stop()`: Stops the reactor loop.
- `Add(int fd, FDListener::Operation op, std::function<void()> callback)`: Adds a file descriptor with an operation and a callback.
- `Remove(int fd, FDListener::Operation op)`: Removes a file descriptor and its operation.

### Classes
- Reactor: Main class that manages file descriptors, operations, and their corresponding callbacks.
- FDListener: Interface class for listening to file descriptor events.
- SelectListener: An implementation of `FDListener` using the `select` system call.
