## Overview
This repository contains a reusable C++ component that implements a thread-safe Singleton pattern.

## Singleton Component

### Singleton.hpp
The `Singleton` template class ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. 
It is thread-safe and uses a combination of atomic operations and mutexes to ensure correct initialization in a multi-threaded environment.

#### Features
- Thread-Safe: Ensures that only one instance of the class is created, even in multi-threaded environments.
- Lazy Initialization: The instance is created only when it is first needed.
- Automatic Cleanup: The instance is automatically cleaned up when the program exits.

### Installation
To use the Singleton component in your project, simply clone the repository and include the `Singleton.hpp` file in your project.
